This project implements an aws data pipe line as seen in the image. Robots that simulate sensor data send data which is ingested, transformed, some events triggered and then stored in a data wharehouse for analysis.

Additionally code will be deployed with CI/CD capabilities using jenkins and IaS using terraform.
